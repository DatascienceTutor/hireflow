Hire Flow: AI-Powered Technical Interview Platform

Hire Flow is a multi-tenant, AI-driven web application built with Streamlit designed to streamline the technical hiring process. It allows hiring managers to create, assign, and review technical interviews, with candidates taking the interviews directly in the app. The platform leverages AI to both generate interview questions on-demand and to automatically score candidate answers, providing detailed feedback.

Core Features

For Hiring Managers
Secure Sign-up: Automatically assigns "Manager" role based on company email domain (e.g., @ibm.com), while public domains (@gmail.com) are assigned the "Candidate" role.
Multi-Tenant Dashboard: Managers only see the jobs, candidates, and interview results associated with their own account (filtered by manager_email).
Job Posting Creation: Upload a Job Description (JD) PDF to create a new Job posting in the system, automatically linked to the manager.
Candidate Onboarding: Upload a Candidate's resume (PDF) and link them to a Job. This automatically creates the Candidate record and their first Interview record with a "Pending" status.
Dynamic Interview Assignment: Managers can assign any Job (that they own) to any Candidate already in the system, creating a new Interview record.
On-Demand AI Question Generation: For a selected candidate's pending interview, managers can click "Generate Questions." This calls the OpenAI API live, using the correct Job Description to generate a unique set of questions specifically for that interview.
Automated Review Dashboard: The dashboard provides a list of completed interviews, showing the candidate's name, job title, and the final, AI-calculated average score (final_score from the Interview table).
Detailed Feedback: Managers can expand any review to see a question-by-question breakdown of the candidate's answer, the llm_score, and qualitative feedback generated by the AI.
For Candidates
Secure Sign-up: Registers with a public email domain.
Multi-Interview Dashboard: Candidates log in to see a list of all pending interviews assigned to them.
Interactive Interview: A clean, step-by-step UI to read and answer each question one at a time.
One-Time Submission: Once an interview is submitted, its status in the Interview table is set to "Completed" and it cannot be retaken. The candidate is then returned to their dashboard, where the completed interview no longer appears on the pending list.
Database & Architecture
The application uses SQLAlchemy as an ORM, which makes it portable across different SQL databases. The models are heavily relational, using integer Primary Keys for joins and ondelete="CASCADE" for automatic data cleanup.
User: Stores login info. Role is determined at signup.
Job: Stores job descriptions. Crucially, it has a manager_email field to ensure multi-tenancy.
Candidate: Stores candidate data. This model is "clean" and not tied to any single job.
Interview: This is the central "junction" table, linking a Job (via job_id) to a Candidate (via candidate_id). It stores the status ("Pending", "Completed") and the final_score.
Question: A specific question that has been generated by the AI and assigned to a Job (links via job_id).
CandidateAnswer: The final record, storing a Candidate's answer to a Question and all AI-generated scoring (llm_score, feedback).

Setup & Local Installation
Follow these steps to get the application running on your local machine.
1. Prerequisites
Python 3.10 or later.
An OpenAI API Key.
2. Clone the Repository
git clone [https://your-repo-url.com/hire-flow.git](https://your-repo-url.com/hire-flow.git)
cd hire-flow


3. Install Dependencies
It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment.
# Create a virtual environment
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install required packages
pip install -r requirements.txt


4. Set Up Environment Variables
Create a file named .env in the root directory. This is critical for the app to function.
.env.example
# Get your key from platform.openai.com
OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."

# Specify the model to use for generation (must support JSON mode)
OPENAI_MODEL="gpt-4o-mini" 


5. Initialize the Database
The first time you run the app, it will create the SQLite database (hireflow.db) and all the tables defined in your models/ directory.
streamlit run app.py


6. Run the Application
You are now ready to run the app!
streamlit run app.py


Open your browser to the local URL (usually http://localhost:8501) and sign up as both a manager (using a company email) and a candidate (using a gmail/outlook email) to test the full flow.
Production Deployment
DO NOT use SQLite in production. It cannot handle concurrent users.
This application is designed to be easily migrated to a production database like PostgreSQL or Azure SQL Server.
Create a Production DB: Create a new "Flexible Server" on Azure Database for PostgreSQL or a similar service (like Neon, Supabase, or AWS RDS).
Install the Driver:
pip install psycopg2-binary


Change Connection String: Update your db/session.py file (or set an environment variable DATABASE_URL) to point to your new database instead of SQLite.Example db/session.py change:
# DATABASE_URL = "sqlite:///./hireflow.db" # <-- Old
DATABASE_URL = "postgresql+psycopg2://<USER>:<PASSWORD>@<HOST>:<PORT>/<DB_NAME>" # <-- New

# ...

# if "sqlite" in DATABASE_URL:
#     engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL, connect_args={"check_same_thread": False})
# else:
//     engine = create_engine(DATABASE_URL) # <-- New


Because you are using SQLAlchemy, no other code changes are required to switch your database.
